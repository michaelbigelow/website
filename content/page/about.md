My name is Michael and I aim to create something awesome.

Sometimes the creative act is a solitary one... other times it is a communal enterprise.  In those latter times the humanity of each member of the team combines with the others to yield a result with a personality all its own.  One that no single member could have produced.

Consider Miles Davis, a man who masterfully executed his craft -- the trumpet -- while as a bandleader orchestrating group after group of the very best musicians to create landmark recordings that defined era after era of jazz music -- *bebop*, *hard bop*, *cool jazz*, *modal jazz*, *fusion*.  With the deepest respect toward that level of mastery on both the individual and the leadership level, I seek to become a master of my own craft while helping to orient the talented and beautiful minds I encounter toward a shared, common ideal.

Whether building business through the science of data by day, or crafting interesting music in what some have called the weird part of the night, I am always aiming to create something awesome. 

Would you join me?
