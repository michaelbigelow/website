      <description>My name is Michael and I aim to create something awesome.&#xA;Sometimes the creative act is a solitary one&amp;hellip; other times it is a communal enterprise. In those latter times the humanity of each member of the team combines with the others to yield a result with a personality all its own. One that no single member could have produced.&#xA;Consider Miles Davis, a man who masterfully executed his craft &amp;ndash; the trumpet &amp;ndash; while as a bandleader orchestrating group after group of the very best musicians to create landmark recordings that defined era after era of jazz music &amp;ndash; bebop, hard bop, cool jazz, modal jazz, fusion.</description>
